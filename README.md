# SELF INTRO
Hello everyone. 
I'm Dheeraj.M, currently a first-year student pursuing Computer Science Engineering (CSE).I believe in the transformative power of technology and look forward to exploring, innovating, and building a brighter future.
# Concern
I wish I had more time to work on the tasks, but due to my late arrival at college and some medical complications, I've only been able to dedicate myself to the work for about 14-16 days.
  I want to emphasize that I thoroughly enjoyed tackling the tasks and experienced significant knowledge improvement. It's clear that my limitation was a matter of time rather than capability, and I take pride in the progress I made during this period.
# WHY MUST YOU CHOOSE ME?
My fascination with technology extends beyond the classroom, thats the reason why i am here. I consider myself a fast learner, always eager to dive into new topics and absorb knowledge quickly. My approach to education and work is driven by a genuine passion for my interests, which fuels my dedication and motivation. Additionally, my strong communication skills have proven to be valuable assets, as they enable me to effectively collaborate with others and contribute to the success of team projects. I'm excited to leverage these qualities to make meaningful contributions to my studies and future endeavors.
# WHAT'S YOUR PLAN FOR THE NEXT 6 MONTHS?
My primary goal is to enhance my coding skills, with a specific focus on mastering the C programming language. I believe that a strong foundation in programming languages is essential for any aspiring computer scientist or engineer. In addition to honing my coding abilities, I aspire to create a comprehensive website for 'Vrindavan Hostel.' This website will serve as a one-stop resource, providing detailed information about the hostel, from its facilities and services to local attractions and contact information. Through this project, I aim to showcase my technical prowess while providing a valuable resource for my hostel mates.
# HOW WOULD YOU CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE CLUB?
I am committed to giving my utmost effort and leveraging my skills to support the club and its members in any way possible. Whether it involves assisting with events, taking on projects, or providing help in any capacity, I am dedicated to going above and beyond to contribute my time and expertise.
# DO YOU HAVE ANY FEEDBACK ON THE SELECTION PROCESS?
 I've had the opportunity to immerse myself in various fields and explore different programming languages, leading to a significant increase in my knowledge. While the journey has been both enjoyable and occasionally frustrating, I've found the entire experience to be incredibly enriching and well-structured. One highlight of this experience has been the exceptional doubt-solving support provided by our assigned seniors, which has been invaluable in helping me navigate through challenges
